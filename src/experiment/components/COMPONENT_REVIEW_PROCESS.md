# Component Review Process

This document outlines the review workflow for new components in the Momentum Experimentation Lab.

## Folder Structure

```
src/experiment/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pending/          # Components awaiting review
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ approved/         # Components approved but not yet in production
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rejected/         # Components that need rework
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Features/         # Production-ready components
```

## Workflow

### 1. Component Creation
- All new components are initially placed in the `pending/` folder
- Each component should have its own folder with:
  - Component files (`.tsx`)
  - Type definitions (if needed)
  - Index file for exports
  - Tests (optional but recommended)

### 2. Component Generator Integration
- New components are automatically added to the Component Generator
- Components appear in the "Pending" tab for review
- Demo components show multiple configurations and use cases
- Test pages provide direct access for testing functionality

### 3. Accessing Components for Review
- **Component Generator**: http://localhost:5173/src/experiment/component-generator
  - Navigate to "Pending" tab to see new components
  - Use üëç to approve or üëé to reject components
  - **Code View Toggle**: Click the code icon (<>) to view minimal component examples with syntax highlighting
  - View live demo implementations
  - Copy import paths with one click
- **Direct Test Routes**: Components may have dedicated test routes
  - Example: http://localhost:5173/src/experiment/datatable-test
- **Navigation**: Use sidebar to access test pages under "Demonstrations"

#### Code View Features
- **Toggle Code View**: Each component card has a code icon button that reveals:
  - Minimal, ready-to-use component example
  - Syntax-highlighted TypeScript/TSX code
  - Line numbers for easy reference
  - Properly formatted props with correct types
  - Import statement ready to copy
- **Smart Code Generation**:
  - Simple props displayed inline
  - Complex props (arrays, objects) properly formatted with indentation
  - Type-safe examples that match actual component interfaces
  - Clean, production-ready code snippets

### 4. Review Process
Components in `pending/` are reviewed for:
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable code following project standards
- **Material-UI Compliance**: Proper use of MUI components and theme
- **TypeScript**: Proper typing and interfaces
- **Performance**: No obvious performance issues
- **Accessibility**: Basic a11y considerations
- **Reusability**: Component is properly abstracted

### 5. Review Outcomes

#### ‚úÖ Approved (Staging)
- Move component folder from `pending/` to `approved/`
- Component has passed code review but awaits final integration
- Can be tested in isolation before production deployment

#### üöÄ Production Ready
- Move component folder from `approved/` to `Features/`
- Update any imports in the main app
- Component is fully integrated and production-ready

#### ‚ùå Rejected
- Move component folder from `pending/` to `rejected/`
- Add a `REJECTION_NOTES.md` file explaining:
  - What needs to be fixed
  - Specific issues found
  - Suggestions for improvement
- Developer can rework and resubmit to `pending/`

#### üîÑ Needs Minor Changes
- Keep in `pending/`
- Add review comments as a `REVIEW_COMMENTS.md` file
- Developer addresses comments and updates the PR

### Using the Code View for Review

When reviewing components:
1. Toggle the code view to see how the component will be used
2. Check that the generated example matches the component's intended API
3. Verify prop types are correctly represented in the example
4. Ensure complex data structures are formatted readably
5. Confirm the import path is correct

## Moving Components

```bash
# Approve a component (to staging)
mv src/experiment/components/pending/ComponentName src/experiment/components/approved/

# Move to production
mv src/experiment/components/approved/ComponentName src/experiment/components/Features/

# Reject a component
mv src/experiment/components/pending/ComponentName src/experiment/components/rejected/

# Resubmit after fixes
mv src/experiment/components/rejected/ComponentName src/experiment/components/pending/
```

Remember to update imports after moving components!

## Best Practices for Component Development

### Creating Review-Friendly Components

1. **Design for the Code View**
   - Ensure your component has sensible default props
   - Use descriptive prop names that are self-documenting
   - Group related props into objects when it makes sense
   - Avoid overly complex prop structures that are hard to demonstrate

2. **Example-Driven Development**
   - Think about how the minimal example will look
   - Provide good demo data in the Component Generator
   - Make sure the component works with the example props
   - Test that the generated code actually runs

3. **Documentation Through Code**
   - The code view example serves as living documentation
   - Make prop interfaces clear and intuitive
   - Use TypeScript types to communicate intent
   - Add JSDoc comments for complex props that will help reviewers

4. **Review Process Integration**
   - Always check the code view during review
   - Ensure the generated example represents best practices
   - Verify that complex props are formatted readably
   - Test copying and using the generated code

### Component Generator Configuration

When adding a new component to the Component Generator:

```typescript
// In ComponentGenerator.tsx, add demo props:
const demoProps: Record<string, any> = {
  YourComponent: {
    title: 'Example Title',
    items: [
      { id: 1, name: 'Item 1', value: 100 },
      { id: 2, name: 'Item 2', value: 200 }
    ],
    onAction: () => console.log('Action triggered'),
    config: {
      theme: 'light',
      showHeader: true
    }
  }
};
```

This ensures that:
- The component renders properly in the preview
- The code view generates a realistic example
- Reviewers can see how the component is intended to be used
- The syntax highlighter can properly format the code

## Approval Workflow for DataTable Components

### Step 1: Review in Component Generator
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/src/experiment/component-generator
2. Go to the "Pending" tab
3. Review each component:
   - **DashboardDataTableCard**: Test search, sorting, pagination, and actions
   - **DashboardDataTableCardDemo**: Check all example configurations
   - **TestPage**: Verify basic functionality

### Step 2: Test Direct Routes
1. Visit http://localhost:5173/src/experiment/datatable-test
2. Test all interactive features
3. Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### Step 3: Code Review
1. Check TypeScript interfaces and prop types
2. Verify Material-UI theme integration
3. Review error handling and loading states
4. Test accessibility features

### Step 4: Approval Decision
- **Approve**: Move to `approved/` folder for staging
- **Reject**: Move to `rejected/` with detailed feedback
- **Minor Changes**: Keep in `pending/` with specific comments

### Step 5: Integration
- Update Component Generator imports
- Add to production routes if needed
- Update documentation and examples
