# Component Review Process

This document outlines the review workflow for new components in the Momentum Experimentation Lab.

## Folder Structure

```
src/experiment/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pending/          # Components awaiting review
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ approved/         # Components approved but not yet in production
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rejected/         # Components that need rework
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Features/         # Production-ready components
```

## Workflow

### 1. Component Creation
- All new components are initially placed in the `pending/` folder
- Each component should have its own folder with:
  - Component files (`.tsx`)
  - Type definitions (if needed)
  - Index file for exports
  - Tests (optional but recommended)

### 2. Component Generator Integration
- New components are automatically added to the Component Generator
- Components appear in the "Pending" tab for review
- Demo components show multiple configurations and use cases
- Test pages provide direct access for testing functionality

### 3. Accessing Components for Review
- **Component Generator**: http://localhost:5173/src/experiment/component-generator
  - Navigate to "Pending" tab to see new components
  - Use üëç to approve or üëé to reject components
  - View code and demo implementations
- **Direct Test Routes**: Components may have dedicated test routes
  - Example: http://localhost:5173/src/experiment/datatable-test
- **Navigation**: Use sidebar to access test pages under "Demonstrations"

### 4. Review Process
Components in `pending/` are reviewed for:
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable code following project standards
- **Material-UI Compliance**: Proper use of MUI components and theme
- **TypeScript**: Proper typing and interfaces
- **Performance**: No obvious performance issues
- **Accessibility**: Basic a11y considerations
- **Reusability**: Component is properly abstracted

### 5. Review Outcomes

#### ‚úÖ Approved (Staging)
- Move component folder from `pending/` to `approved/`
- Component has passed code review but awaits final integration
- Can be tested in isolation before production deployment

#### üöÄ Production Ready
- Move component folder from `approved/` to `Features/`
- Update any imports in the main app
- Component is fully integrated and production-ready

#### ‚ùå Rejected
- Move component folder from `pending/` to `rejected/`
- Add a `REJECTION_NOTES.md` file explaining:
  - What needs to be fixed
  - Specific issues found
  - Suggestions for improvement
- Developer can rework and resubmit to `pending/`

#### üîÑ Needs Minor Changes
- Keep in `pending/`
- Add review comments as a `REVIEW_COMMENTS.md` file
- Developer addresses comments and updates the PR

## Current Components in Review

### Pending
- **DashboardDataTableCard** - Comprehensive dashboard data table component with search, sorting, pagination, and action buttons
- **DashboardDataTableCardDemo** - Full demonstration component showing multiple configurations and use cases
- **TestPage** - Simple test implementation for the DashboardDataTableCard component

### Approved (Staging)
- **BudgetCategoryCard** - Category-wise budget tracking with visual indicators

## Moving Components

```bash
# Approve a component (to staging)
mv src/experiment/components/pending/ComponentName src/experiment/components/approved/

# Move to production
mv src/experiment/components/approved/ComponentName src/experiment/components/Features/

# Reject a component
mv src/experiment/components/pending/ComponentName src/experiment/components/rejected/

# Resubmit after fixes
mv src/experiment/components/rejected/ComponentName src/experiment/components/pending/
```

Remember to update imports after moving components!

## Approval Workflow for DataTable Components

### Step 1: Review in Component Generator

2. Go to the "Pending" tab
3. Review each component:
   - **DashboardDataTableCard**: Test search, sorting, pagination, and actions
   - **DashboardDataTableCardDemo**: Check all example configurations
   - **TestPage**: Verify basic functionality

### Step 2: Test Direct Routes
1. Visit http://localhost:5173/src/experiment/datatable-test
2. Test all interactive features
3. Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### Step 3: Code Review
1. Check TypeScript interfaces and prop types
2. Verify Material-UI theme integration
3. Review error handling and loading states

### Step 4: Approval Decision
- **Approve**: Move to `approved/` folder for staging
- **Reject**: Move to `rejected/` with detailed feedback
- **Minor Changes**: Keep in `pending/` with specific comments

### Step 5: Integration
